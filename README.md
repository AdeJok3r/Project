Welcome to my repository!
Here you’ll find all my projects, exercises, technical tests, and personal developments created throughout my learning path and experience in IT and cybersecurity.
The purpose of this folder is to have a single, organized space that showcases:

💻 complete projects
🧪 exercises and Proof of Concept (PoC)
🔐 cybersecurity-related work
🛠 scripts, tools, and lab tests
📚 documentation and technical analyses

Each project has its own dedicated folder, with a README and specific explanations.
This repository will be continuously updated with new work, improvements, and experiments.
